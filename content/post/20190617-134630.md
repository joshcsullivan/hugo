# Live on Hugo with Jane Theme

I've finally deployed a Hugo site with the Jane theme.

I did so thanks to these posts:

* [Ec-static - How to go Hugo - Bryce Wray](https://brycewray.com/posts/2019/04/ec-static/)
* [Publish or perish - Going live with your Hugo site - Bryce Wray](https://brycewray.com/posts/2019/04/publish-or-perish/)
