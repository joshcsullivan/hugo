Publishing with Hugo is a little more complicated, and therefore I've decided only long-form posts will be posted to this Hugo site.

I am also going to be posting tutorials and reference material that I previously posted to the Blot blog. Smaller posts and of course, Micro posts, will all stay on the Blot blog. If David or Jack [port the Jane theme to blot](https://micro.blog/Blot/4101419), then I will probably change back to Blot for long-form posts. Currently, I like the Jane theme and think it fits long form posts well.

We'll see how long this lasts, or if I get tired of using Git to publish, but right now it's a perfect fit for what I want to accomplish. I'm thrilled with the code blocks with syntax highlighting as well.

When used with Netlify, a Hugo site will stay live even if you mess up a commit or screw up the config. It won't allow you to add content until you fix it, but Netlify will keep the previous good build published until a new good build can be published, which I appreciate. Another thing Hugo allows is the ability to publish the site locally so you can check for errors before making a commit, or see how a post will look in the live site. With Blot, I had to have a separate test blog, which I was/am happy to pay for to support ongoing development. I know Blot has the static HTML file you can use with a draft post, but it's nice to be able to see live changes immediately after saving.


Overall, I'm pleased with Hugo and can't wait to start publishing more long-form posts, this may be the push I need to publish one or more long-form post a week, but as always I'm making no promises.
