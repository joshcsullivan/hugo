Monica CRM was a very interesting experiment but it won't last. TheBrain makes better connections for people, plus the notes and attachments are great in TheBrain but in Monica were a bit tedious to maintain. I like the interface and with some basic improvements it would do great. At this point in time I don't think it is at a point where I can move everything from DEVONthink and TheBrain into Monica.

I am going to keep Monica up and running, I've moved it to one of my production Droplets on DigitalOcean so I can have the test server back. I'll see if the updates in the future help improve notes/attachments and hope one day it can replace the homemade solution I have now.
